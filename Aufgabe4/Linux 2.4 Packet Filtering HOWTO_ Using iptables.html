<h2><a name="s7">7.</a> <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO.html#toc7">Using iptables</a></h2>

<p>iptables has a fairly detailed manual page (<code>man iptables</code>),
and if you need more detail on particulars.  Those of you familiar
with ipchains may simply want to look at 
<a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO-10.html#Appendix-A">Differences Between iptables and ipchains</a>; they are very
similar.</p>

<p>There are several different things you can do with <code>iptables</code>.
You start with three built-in chains <code>INPUT</code>, <code>OUTPUT</code>
and <code>FORWARD</code> which you can't delete.  Let's look at the
operations to manage whole chains:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> Create a new chain (-N).</li>
<li> Delete an empty chain (-X).</li>
<li> Change the policy for a built-in chain. (-P).</li>
<li> List the rules in a chain (-L).</li>
<li> Flush the rules out of a chain (-F).</li>
<li> Zero the packet and byte counters on all rules in a chain (-Z).</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>There are several ways to manipulate rules inside a chain:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> Append a new rule to a chain (-A).</li>
<li> Insert a new rule at some position in a chain (-I).</li>
<li> Replace a rule at some position in a chain (-R).</li>
<li> Delete a rule at some position in a chain, or the first that matches (-D).</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<h2><a name="ss7.1">7.1</a> <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO.html#toc7.1">What You'll See When Your Computer Starts Up</a>
</h2>

<p>iptables may be a module, called (`iptable_filter.o'), which should be
automatically loaded when you first run <code>iptables</code>.  It can
also be built into the kernel permenantly.</p>

<p>Before any iptables commands have been run (be careful: some
distributions will run iptables in their initialization scripts),
there will be no rules in any of the built-in chains (`INPUT',
`FORWARD' and `OUTPUT'), all the chains will have a policy of ACCEPT.
You can alter the default policy of the FORWARD chain by providing the
`forward=0' option to the iptable_filter module.</p>

<h2><a name="ss7.2">7.2</a> <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO.html#toc7.2">Operations on a Single Rule</a>
</h2>

<p>This is the bread-and-butter of packet filtering; manipulating rules.
Most commonly, you will probably use the append (-A) and delete (-D)
commands.  The others (-I for insert and -R for replace) are simple
extensions of these concepts.</p>

<p>Each rule specifies a set of conditions the packet must meet, and what
to do if it meets them (a `target').  For example, you might want to
drop all ICMP packets coming from the IP address 127.0.0.1.  So in
this case our conditions are that the protocol must be ICMP and that
the source address must be 127.0.0.1.  Our target is `DROP'.</p>

<p>127.0.0.1 is the `loopback' interface, which you will have even if you
have no real network connection.  You can use the `ping' program to
generate such packets (it simply sends an ICMP type 8 (echo request)
which all cooperative hosts should obligingly respond to with an ICMP
type 0 (echo reply) packet).  This makes it useful for testing.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># ping -c 1 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.2 ms

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.2/0.2/0.2 ms
# iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p icmp -j DROP
# ping -c 1 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>You can see here that the first ping succeeds (the `-c 1' tells ping
to only send a single packet).</p>

<p>Then we append (-A) to the `INPUT' chain, a rule specifying that for
packets from 127.0.0.1 (`-s 127.0.0.1') with protocol ICMP (`-p icmp')
we should jump to DROP (`-j DROP').</p>

<p>Then we test our rule, using the second ping.  There will be a pause
before the program gives up waiting for a response that will never
come.</p>

<p>We can delete the rule in one of two ways.  Firstly, since we know
that it is the only rule in the input chain, we can use a numbered
delete, as in:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>        # iptables -D INPUT 1
        #
</pre>
</blockquote>

To delete rule number 1 in the INPUT chain.<p></p>

<p>The second way is to mirror the -A command, but replacing the -A with
-D.  This is useful when you have a complex chain of rules and you
don't want to have to count them to figure out that it's rule 37 that
you want to get rid of.  In this case, we would use:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>        # iptables -D INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p icmp -j DROP
        #
</pre>
</blockquote>

The syntax of -D must have exactly the same options as the -A (or -I
or -R) command.  If there are multiple identical rules in the same
chain, only the first will be deleted.<p></p>

<h2><a name="ss7.3">7.3</a> <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO.html#toc7.3">Filtering Specifications</a>
</h2>

<p>We have seen the use of `-p' to specify protocol, and `-s' to specify
source address, but there are other options we can use to specify
packet characteristics.  What follows is an exhaustive compendium.</p>

<h3>Specifying Source and Destination IP Addresses</h3>

<p>Source (`-s', `--source' or `--src') and destination (`-d',
`--destination' or `--dst') IP addresses can be specified in four
ways.  The most common way is to use the full name, such as
`localhost' or `www.linuxhq.com'.  The second way is to specify the IP
address such as `127.0.0.1'.</p>

<p>The third and fourth ways allow specification of a group of IP
addresses, such as `199.95.207.0/24' or `199.95.207.0/255.255.255.0'.
These both specify any IP address from 199.95.207.0 to 199.95.207.255
inclusive; the digits after the `/' tell which parts of the IP address
are significant.  `/32' or `/255.255.255.255' is the default (match
all of the IP address).  To specify any IP address at all `/0' can be
used, like so:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>        [ NOTE: `-s 0/0' is redundant here. ]
        # iptables -A INPUT -s 0/0 -j DROP
        #
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This is rarely used, as the effect above is the same as not specifying
the `-s' option at all.</p>

<h3>Specifying Inversion</h3>

<p>Many flags, including the `-s' (or `--source') and `-d'
(`--destination') flags can have their arguments preceded by `!'
(pronounced `not') to match addresses NOT equal to the ones given.
For example. `-s ! localhost' matches any packet <b>not</b> coming
from localhost.</p>

<h3>Specifying Protocol</h3>

<p>The protocol can be specified with the `-p' (or `--protocol') flag.
Protocol can be a number (if you know the numeric protocol values for
IP) or a name for the special cases of `TCP', `UDP' or `ICMP'.  Case
doesn't matter, so `tcp' works as well as `TCP'.</p>

<p>The protocol name can be prefixed by a `!', to invert it, such as `-p
! TCP' to specify packets which are <b>not</b> TCP.</p>

<h3>Specifying an Interface</h3>

<p>The `-i' (or `--in-interface') and `-o' (or `--out-interface') options
specify the name of an <b>interface</b> to match.  An interface is
the physical device the packet came in on (`-i') or is going out on
(`-o').  You can use the <code>ifconfig</code> command to list the
interfaces which are `up' (i.e., working at the moment).</p>

<p>Packets traversing the <code>INPUT</code> chain don't have an output
interface, so any rule using `-o' in this chain will never match.
Similarly, packets traversing the <code>OUTPUT</code> chain don't have an
input interface, so any rule using `-i' in this chain will never match.</p>

<p>Only packets traversing the <code>FORWARD</code> chain have both an
input and output interface.</p>

<p>It is perfectly legal to specify an interface that currently does not
exist; the rule will not match anything until the interface comes up.
This is extremely useful for dial-up PPP links (usually interface
<code>ppp0</code>) and the like.</p>

<p>As a special case, an interface name ending with a `+' will match all
interfaces (whether they currently exist or not) which begin with that
string.  For example, to specify a rule which matches all PPP
interfaces, the <code>-i ppp+</code> option would be used.</p>

<p>The interface name can be preceded by a `!' with spaces around it, to
match a packet which does <b>not</b> match the specified
interface(s), eg <code>-i ! ppp+</code>.</p>

<h3>Specifying Fragments</h3>

<p>Sometimes a packet is too large to fit down a wire all at once.  When
this happens, the packet is divided into <b>fragments</b>, and sent
as multiple packets.  The other end reassembles these fragments to
reconstruct the whole packet.</p>

<p>The problem with fragments is that the initial fragment has the
complete header fields (IP + TCP, UDP and ICMP) to examine, but
subsequent packets only have a subset of the headers (IP without the
additional protocol fields).  Thus looking inside subsequent fragments
for protocol headers (such as is done by the TCP, UDP and ICMP
extensions) is not possible.</p>

<p>If you are doing connection tracking or NAT, then all fragments will
get merged back together before they reach the packet filtering code,
so you need never worry about fragments.</p>

<p>Please also note that in the INPUT chain of the filter table (or any other
table hooking into the NF_IP_LOCAL_IN hook) is traversed after
defragmentation of the core IP stack.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it is important to understand how fragments get treated by
the filtering rules.  Any filtering rule that asks for information we
don't have will <em>not</em> match.  This means that the first fragment is
treated like any other packet.  Second and further fragments won't be.
Thus a rule <code>-p TCP --sport www</code> (specifying a source port of
`www') will never match a fragment (other than the first fragment).
Neither will the opposite rule <code>-p TCP --sport ! www</code>.</p>

<p>However, you can specify a rule specifically for second and further
fragments, using the `-f' (or `--fragment') flag.  It is also legal to
specify that a rule does <em>not</em> apply to second and further
fragments, by preceding the `-f' with ` ! '.</p>

<p>Usually it is regarded as safe to let second and further fragments
through, since filtering will effect the first fragment, and thus
prevent reassembly on the target host; however, bugs have been known
to allow crashing of machines simply by sending fragments.  Your call.</p>

<p>Note for network-heads: malformed packets (TCP, UDP and ICMP packets
too short for the firewalling code to read the ports or ICMP code and
type) are dropped when such examinations are attempted.  So are TCP
fragments starting at position 8.</p>

<p>As an example, the following rule will drop any fragments going to
192.168.1.1:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -A OUTPUT -f -d 192.168.1.1 -j DROP
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<h3>Extensions to iptables: New Matches</h3>

<p><code>iptables</code> is <b>extensible</b>, meaning that both the
kernel and the iptables tool can be extended to provide new features.</p>

<p>Some of these extensions are standard, and other are more exotic.
Extensions can be made by other people and distributed separately for
niche users.</p>

<p>Kernel extensions normally live in the kernel module subdirectory,
such as /lib/modules/2.4.0-test10/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter.  They are demand loaded if your
kernel was compiled with CONFIG_KMOD set, so you should not need to
manually insert them.</p>

<p>Extensions to the iptables program are shared libraries which
usually live in /usr/local/lib/iptables/, although a distribution
would put them in /lib/iptables or /usr/lib/iptables.</p>

<p>Extensions come in two types: new targets, and new matches (we'll
talk about new targets a little later).  Some protocols automatically
offer new tests: currently these are TCP, UDP and ICMP as shown below.</p>

<p>For these you will be able to specify the new tests on the command
line after the `-p' option, which will load the extension.  For
explicit new tests, use the `-m' option to load the extension, after
which the extended options will be available.</p>

<p>To get help on an extension, use the option to load it (`-p', `-j' or
`-m') followed by `-h' or `--help', eg:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -p tcp --help
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<h3>TCP Extensions</h3>

<p>The TCP extensions are automatically loaded if `-p tcp' is specified.
It provides the following options (none of which match fragments).</p>

<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>--tcp-flags</b></dt><dd><p>Followed by an optional `!', then two strings
of flags, allows you to filter on specific TCP flags.  The first
string of flags is the mask: a list of flags you want to examine.  The
second string of flags tells which one(s) should be set.  For example,</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -A INPUT --protocol tcp --tcp-flags ALL SYN,ACK -j DROP
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This indicates that all flags should be examined (`ALL' is synonymous
with `SYN,ACK,FIN,RST,URG,PSH'), but only SYN and ACK should be set.
There is also an argument `NONE' meaning no flags.</p>

</dd><dt><b>--syn</b></dt><dd><p>Optionally preceded by a `!', this is shorthand
for `--tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN'.</p>

</dd><dt><b>--source-port</b></dt><dd><p>followed by an optional `!', then either a
single TCP port, or a range of ports.  Ports can be port names, as
listed in /etc/services, or numeric.  Ranges are either two port names
separated by a `:', or (to specify greater than or equal to a given
port) a port with a `:' appended, or (to specify less than or equal to
a given port), a port preceded by a `:'.</p>

</dd><dt><b>--sport</b></dt><dd><p>is synonymous with `--source-port'.</p>

</dd><dt><b>--destination-port</b></dt><dd><p>and </p>
</dd><dt><b>--dport</b></dt><dd><p>are the same as
above, only they specify the destination, rather than source, port to
match.</p>

</dd><dt><b>--tcp-option</b></dt><dd><p>followed by an optional `!' and a number,
matches a packet with a TCP option equaling that number.  A packet
which does not have a complete TCP header is dropped automatically if
an attempt is made to examine its TCP options.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>

<h3>An Explanation of TCP Flags</h3>

<p>It is sometimes useful to allow TCP connections in one direction, but
not the other.  For example, you might want to allow connections to an
external WWW server, but not connections from that server.</p>

<p>The naive approach would be to block TCP packets coming from the
server.  Unfortunately, TCP connections require packets going in both
directions to work at all.</p>

<p>The solution is to block only the packets used to request a
connection.  These packets are called <b>SYN</b> packets (ok,
technically they're packets with the SYN flag set, and the RST and ACK
flags cleared, but we call them SYN packets for short).  By
disallowing only these packets, we can stop attempted connections in
their tracks.</p>

<p>The `--syn' flag is used for this: it is only valid for rules which
specify TCP as their protocol.  For example, to specify TCP connection
attempts from 192.168.1.1:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>-p TCP -s 192.168.1.1 --syn
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>This flag can be inverted by preceding it with a `!', which means
every packet other than the connection initiation.</p>

<h3>UDP Extensions</h3>

<p>These extensions are automatically loaded if `-p udp' is specified.
It provides the options `--source-port', `--sport',
`--destination-port' and `--dport' as detailed for TCP above.</p>

<h3>ICMP Extensions</h3>

<p>This extension is automatically loaded if `-p icmp' is specified.  It
provides only one new option:</p>

<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>--icmp-type</b></dt><dd><p>followed by an optional `!', then either an
icmp type name (eg `host-unreachable'), or a numeric type (eg. `3'),
or a numeric type and code separated by a `/' (eg. `3/3').  A list
of available icmp type names is given using `-p icmp --help'.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>

<h3>Other Match Extensions</h3>

<p>The other extensions in the netfilter package are demonstration
extensions, which (if installed) can be invoked with the `-m' option.</p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>mac</b></dt><dd><p>This module must be explicitly specified with `-m mac'
or `--match mac'.  It is used for matching incoming packet's source
Ethernet (MAC) address, and thus only useful for packets traversing
the PREROUTING and INPUT chains.  It provides only one option:</p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>--mac-source</b></dt><dd><p>followed by an optional `!', then an
ethernet address in colon-separated hexbyte notation, eg
`--mac-source 00:60:08:91:CC:B7'.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>

</dd><dt><b>limit</b></dt><dd><p>This module must be explicitly specified with `-m
limit' or `--match limit'.  It is used to restrict the rate of
matches, such as for suppressing log messages.  It will only match a
given number of times per second (by default 3 matches per hour,
with a burst of 5).  It takes two optional arguments:</p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>--limit</b></dt><dd><p>followed by a number; specifies the maximum
average number of matches to allow per second.  The number can
specify units explicitly, using `/second', `/minute', `/hour' or
`/day', or parts of them (so `5/second' is the same as `5/s').</p>

</dd><dt><b>--limit-burst</b></dt><dd><p>followed by a number, indicating the
maximum burst before the above limit kicks in.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>This match can often be used with the LOG target to do rate-limited
logging.  To understand how it works, let's look at the following
rule, which logs packets with the default limit parameters:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -A FORWARD -m limit -j LOG
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The first time this rule is reached, the packet will be logged; in
fact, since the default burst is 5, the first five packets will be
logged.  After this, it will be twenty minutes before a packet will be
logged from this rule, regardless of how many packets reach it.  Also,
every twenty minutes which passes without matching a packet, one of
the burst will be regained; if no packets hit the rule for 100
minutes, the burst will be fully recharged; back where we started.</p>

<p>Note: you cannot currently create a rule with a recharge time
greater than about 59 hours, so if you set an average rate of one per
day, then your burst rate must be less than 3.</p>

<p>You can also use this module to avoid various denial of service
attacks (DoS) with a faster rate to increase responsiveness.</p>

<p>Syn-flood protection:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --syn -m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Furtive port scanner:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST RST -m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Ping of death:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This module works like a "hysteresis door", as shown in the graph
below.  </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>       rate (pkt/s)  
             ^        .---.

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Say we say match one packet per second with a five packet
burst, but packets start coming in at four per second, for three
seconds, then start again in another three seconds.
</p><blockquote><code>

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>You can see that the first five packets are allowed to exceed the one
packet per second, then the limiting kicks in.  If there is a pause,
another burst is allowed but not past the maximum rate set by the
rule (1 packet per second after the burst is used).</p>

</dd><dt><b>owner</b></dt><dd><p>This module attempts to match various characteristics of the packet
creator, for locally-generated packets.  It is only valid in the
OUTPUT chain, and even then some packets (such as ICMP ping responses)
may have no owner, and hence never match.</p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>--uid-owner userid</b></dt><dd><p>Matches if the packet was created by a process with the given

process id.</p>
</dd><dt><b>--sid-owner sessionid</b></dt><dd><p>Matches if the packet was created by a process in the given session
group.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>

</dd><dt><b>unclean</b></dt><dd><p>This experimental module must be explicitly
specified with `-m unclean or `--match unclean'.  It does various
random sanity checks on packets.  This module has not been audited,
and should not be used as a security device (it probably makes things
worse, since it may well have bugs itself).  It provides no options.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>

<h3>The State Match</h3>

<p>The most useful match criterion is supplied by the `state'
extension, which interprets the connection-tracking analysis of the
`ip_conntrack' module.  This is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Specifying `-m state' allows an additional `--state' option, which
is a comma-separated list of states to match (the `!'  flag indicates
<b>not</b> to match those states).  These states are:</p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>NEW</b></dt><dd><p>A packet which creates a new connection.</p>

</dd><dt><b>ESTABLISHED</b></dt><dd><p>A packet which belongs to an existing
connection (i.e., a reply packet, or outgoing packet on a connection
which has seen replies).</p>

</dd><dt><b>RELATED</b></dt><dd><p>A packet which is related to, but not part of, an
existing connection, such as an ICMP error, or (with the FTP module
inserted), a packet establishing an ftp data connection.</p>

</dd><dt><b>INVALID</b></dt><dd><p>A packet which could not be identified for some
reason: this includes running out of memory and ICMP errors which
don't correspond to any known connection.  Generally these packets
should be dropped.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>An example of this powerful match extension would be: 
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -m state ! --state NEW -j DROP
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="ss7.4">7.4</a> <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO.html#toc7.4">Target Specifications</a>
</h2>

<p>Now we know what examinations we can do on a packet, we need a way
of saying what to do to the packets which match our tests.  This is
called a rule's <b>target</b>.</p>

<p>There are two very simple built-in targets: DROP and ACCEPT.  We've
already met them.  If a rule matches a packet and its target is one of
these two, no further rules are consulted: the packet's fate has been
decided.</p>

<p>There are two types of targets other than the built-in ones:
extensions and user-defined chains.</p>

<h3>User-defined chains</h3>

<p>One powerful feature which <code>iptables</code> inherits from
<code>ipchains</code> is the ability for the user to create new chains, in
addition to the three built-in ones (INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT).  By
convention, user-defined chains are lower-case to distinguish them
(we'll describe how to create new user-defined chains below in 
<a href="https://pub.informatik.haw-hamburg.de/home/pub/staff/schulz_hartmut/Rechnernetze/tools/iptables/packet-filtering-HOWTO-7.html#chain-ops">Operations on an Entire Chain</a>).</p>

<p>When a packet matches a rule whose target is a user-defined chain, the
packet begins traversing the rules in that user-defined chain.  If
that chain doesn't decide the fate of the packet, then once traversal
on that chain has finished, traversal resumes on the next rule in the
current chain.</p>

<p>Time for more ASCII art.  Consider two (silly) chains: <code>INPUT</code> (the
built-in chain) and <code>test</code> (a user-defined chain).</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>         `INPUT'                         `test'
        ----------------------------    ----------------------------
        | Rule1: -p ICMP -j DROP   |    | Rule1: -s 192.168.1.1    |
        |--------------------------|    |--------------------------|
        | Rule2: -p TCP -j test    |    | Rule2: -d 192.168.1.1    |
        |--------------------------|    ----------------------------
        | Rule3: -p UDP -j DROP    |
        ----------------------------
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>Consider a TCP packet coming from 192.168.1.1, going to 1.2.3.4.  It
enters the <code>INPUT</code> chain, and gets tested against Rule1 - no match.
Rule2 matches, and its target is <code>test</code>, so the next rule examined
is the start of <code>test</code>.  Rule1 in <code>test</code> matches, but doesn't
specify a target, so the next rule is examined, Rule2.  This doesn't
match, so we have reached the end of the chain.  We return to the
<code>INPUT</code> chain, where we had just examined Rule2, so we now examine
Rule3, which doesn't match either.</p>

<p>So the packet path is:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>                                v    __________________________
         `INPUT'                |   /    `test'                v
        ------------------------|--/    -----------------------|----
        | Rule1                 | /|    | Rule1                |   |
        |-----------------------|/-|    |----------------------|---|
        | Rule2                 /  |    | Rule2                |   |
        |--------------------------|    -----------------------v----
        | Rule3                 /--+___________________________/
        ------------------------|---
                                v
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>User-defined chains can jump to other user-defined chains (but
don't make loops: your packets will be dropped if they're found to
be in a loop).</p>

<h3>Extensions to iptables: New Targets</h3>

<p>The other type of extension is a target.  A target extension
consists of a kernel module, and an optional extension to
<code>iptables</code> to provide new command line options.  There are
several extensions in the default netfilter distribution:</p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>LOG</b></dt><dd><p>This module provides kernel logging of matching
packets.  It provides these additional options:
</p><dl>
<dt><b>--log-level</b></dt><dd><p>Followed by a level number or name.  Valid
names are (case-insensitive) `debug', `info', `notice', `warning',
`err', `crit', `alert' and `emerg', corresponding to numbers 7
through 0.  See the man page for syslog.conf for an explanation of
these levels.  The default is `warning'.</p>

</dd><dt><b>--log-prefix</b></dt><dd><p>Followed by a string of up to 29 characters,
this message is sent at the start of the log message, to allow it to
be uniquely identified.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>This module is most useful after a limit match, so you don't flood
your logs.</p>

</dd><dt><b>REJECT</b></dt><dd><p>This module has the same effect as `DROP', except
that the sender is sent an ICMP `port unreachable' error message.
Note that the ICMP error message is not sent if (see RFC 1122):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> The packet being filtered was an ICMP error message in the
first place, or some unknown ICMP type.
</li>
<li> The packet being filtered was a non-head fragment.
</li>
<li> We've sent too many ICMP error messages to that destination
recently (see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_ratelimit).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>REJECT also takes a `--reject-with' optional argument which alters the
reply packet used: see the manual page.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>

<h3>Special Built-In Targets</h3>

<p>There are two special built-in targets: <code>RETURN</code> and
<code>QUEUE</code>.</p>

<p><code>RETURN</code> has the same effect of falling off the end of a
chain: for a rule in a built-in chain, the policy of the chain is
executed.  For a rule in a user-defined chain, the traversal continues
at the previous chain, just after the rule which jumped to this chain.</p>

<p><code>QUEUE</code> is a special target, which queues the packet for
userspace processing.  For this to be useful, two further components are
required:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>a "queue handler", which deals with the actual mechanics of
passing packets between the kernel and userspace; and</li>
<li>a userspace application to receive, possibly manipulate, and
issue verdicts on packets.</li>
</ul>

The standard queue handler for IPv4 iptables is the ip_queue module,
which is distributed with the kernel and marked as experimental.<p></p>
<p>The following is a quick example of how to use iptables to queue packets
for userspace processing:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># modprobe iptable_filter
# modprobe ip_queue
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -j QUEUE
</pre>
</blockquote>

With this rule, locally generated outgoing ICMP packets (as created with,
say, ping) are passed to the ip_queue module, which then attempts to deliver
the packets to a userspace application.  If no userspace application is 
waiting, the packets are dropped.<p></p>

<p>To write a userspace application, use the libipq API.  This is
distributed with iptables.  Example code may be found in the testsuite
tools (e.g. redirect.c) in CVS.</p>

<p>The status of ip_queue may be checked via:
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre>/proc/net/ip_queue
</pre>
</blockquote>

The maximum length of the queue (i.e. the number packets delivered
to userspace with no verdict issued back) may be controlled via:
<blockquote><code>
</code><pre>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_queue_maxlen
</pre>
</blockquote>

The default value for the maximum queue length is 1024.  Once this limit 
is reached, new packets will be dropped until the length of the queue falls
below the limit again.  Nice protocols such as TCP interpret dropped packets
as congestion, and will hopefully back off when the queue fills up.  However,
it may take some experimenting to determine an ideal maximum queue length 
for a given situation if the default value is too small.<p></p>

</h2>

<p>A very useful feature of <code>iptables</code> is the ability to group
related rules into chains.  You can call the chains whatever you want,
but I recommend using lower-case letters to avoid confusion with the
built-in chains and targets.  Chain names can be up to 31 letters
long.</p>

<h3>Creating a New Chain</h3>

<p>Let's create a new chain.  Because I am such an imaginative fellow,
I'll call it <code>test</code>.  We use the `-N' or `--new-chain' options:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -N test
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>It's that simple.  Now you can put rules in it as detailed above.</p>

<h3>Deleting a Chain</h3>

<p>Deleting a chain is simple as well, using the `-X' or `--delete-chain'
options.  Why `-X'?  Well, all the good letters were taken.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -X test
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>There are a couple of restrictions to deleting chains: they must be
empty (see 
<a href="https://pub.informatik.haw-hamburg.de/home/pub/staff/schulz_hartmut/Rechnernetze/tools/iptables/packet-filtering-HOWTO-7.html#flushing">Flushing a Chain</a> below) and they
must not be the target of any rule.  You can't delete any of the three
built-in chains.</p>

<p>If you don't specify a chain, then <em>all</em> user-defined chains
will be deleted, if possible.</p>

<h3><a name="flushing"></a> Flushing a Chain</h3>

<p>There is a simple way of emptying all rules out of a chain, using the
`-F' (or `--flush') commands.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -F FORWARD
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>If you don't specify a chain, then <em>all</em> chains will be flushed.</p>

<h3>Listing a Chain</h3>

<p>You can list all the rules in a chain by using the `-L' (or `--list')
command.</p>

<p>The `refcnt' listed for each user-defined chain is the number of rules
which have that chain as their target.  This must be zero (and the
chain be empty) before this chain can be deleted.</p>

<p>If the chain name is omitted, all chains are listed, even empty ones.</p>

<p>There are three options which can accompany `-L'.  The `-n' (numeric)
option is very useful as it prevents <code>iptables</code> from trying to
lookup the IP addresses, which (if you are using DNS like most people)
will cause large delays if your DNS is not set up properly, or you
have filtered out DNS requests.  It also causes TCP and UDP ports to
be printed out as numbers rather than names.</p>

<p>The `-v' options shows you all the details of the rules, such as the
the packet and byte counters, the TOS comparisons, and the interfaces.
Otherwise these values are omitted.</p>

<p>Note that the packet and byte counters are printed out using the
suffixes `K', `M' or `G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000
respectively.  Using the `-x' (expand numbers) flag as well prints the
full numbers, no matter how large they are.</p>

<h3>Resetting (Zeroing) Counters</h3>

<p>It is useful to be able to reset the counters.  This can be done with
the `-Z' (or `--zero') option.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -L FORWARD
# iptables -Z FORWARD
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>In the above example, some packets could pass through between the `-L'
and `-Z' commands.  For this reason, you can use the `-L' and `-Z'
<em>together</em>, to reset the counters while reading them.</p>

<h3><a name="policy"></a> Setting Policy</h3>

<p>We glossed over what happens when a packet hits the end of a built-in
chain when we discussed how a packet walks through chains earlier.  In
this case, the <b>policy</b> of the chain determines the fate of the
packet.  Only built-in chains (<code>INPUT</code>, <code>OUTPUT</code> and
<code>FORWARD</code>) have policies, because if a packet falls off the end
of a user-defined chain, traversal resumes at the previous chain.</p>

<p>The policy can be either <code>ACCEPT</code> or <code>DROP</code>, for
example:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
</code><pre># iptables -P FORWARD DROP
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
